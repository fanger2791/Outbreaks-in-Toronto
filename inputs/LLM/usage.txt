User: How to only see the first 10 rows of my dataset in R

Chatgpt response:
To limit the display to only the first 10 rows of your dataset, you can use the head() function before passing the data frame to kbl() and kable_classic() for styling. 

User: How to format a table so everything can fit on the page

Chatgpt response:

To ensure that the table fits well and is visually appealing, we can make several adjustments to the code you provided. These adjustments will involve using the kableExtra package functions in R to enhance the appearance and formatting of the table. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the changes:

Library Inclusion: Ensure kableExtra is included, as it provides the necessary functions for table formatting.
Row Selection: You mentioned displaying the first 10 rows, but the code selects the first 40 rows. We'll correct this to display the first 10 rows.
Table Formatting: Use kableExtra functions to modify the table appearance. This includes setting column widths and possibly truncating text if necessary.
Caption and Styling: Modify the caption for accuracy and apply a classic style for readability.

User: How to change tbble to a data frame:

Chatgpt response:

Tibbles are automatically generated by R when using the tibble function from the tidyverse package, and when you print a tibble to the console. These are informative messages indicating the type of object (tibble) and the types of columns (like <chr> for character vectors).

If you prefer to view the data without these messages, you can convert the tibble to a regular data frame before printing it. Regular data frames do not display this additional type information when printed. You can do this by wrapping the simulated_data tibble with the as.data.frame() function before printing.
